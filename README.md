# openag_sim

## How to simulate:

### Prerequisites
* A Windows machine with Scilab and GreenScilab installed.
	* Setting up a Windows VM is sufficient.
	* Inside Windows, run scilab-4.1.exe (in the repository’s Software folder).
	* Place Software/GreenScilabV0.9 folder inside now-installed Scilab’s “contrib” folder.
	* Open Scilab. Run command ‘exec([path to the ‘loader’ file inside Greenlab])’
	* Run command ‘exec(“fun1.sci”)’ to have access to the prewritten simulator function.
